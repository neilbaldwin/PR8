+ unroll the bigger decode loops (decodeDrum for example) to speed up

+ Proper transport controls

+ Update manual with changes to Song controls (hold and release for certain parameters)


Bugs
----

- still possible to put note values outside of legal range - can't figure out how yet!!

- not all parameters can be used with a tie note as they don't init properly
    LFO stuff especially, maybe others


Ideas
-----
+ make delete/clear = hold B and tap A instead of just tapping A

+ add a delay parameter to each voice?

+ ability to move up/down in Drum Editor

+ Make green markers use cursor palette (so they pulse red)

+ If in Song Rec mode, changing editor Pattern should write that pattern number to current song Step

[DONE]+ add slide stuff to manual
[DONE]+ enable holding of U/D/L/R in trigger parameters
[DONE]+ add confirmations to CLR menu selections?
[DONE] BUG - notes go too high - get corrupt display at top end of note names
[DONE] BUG - it's possible to modify trigger values in empty cells
[DONE]+ set some sensible defaults for M-- parameters when tapping A to add a trigger
[DONE]+ add some error messages (clone, pasting etc.)
[DONE]+ redo all screen-shots for manual again! THIS TIME TURN DEBUG NUMBERS OFF!
[DONE]+ Make sure all 'N's are in the lower case shape to avoid confusion with 'W'
[DONE] BUG - changing from a Pattern that has echo to one where it's turned off results in 'hanging' audio
[DONE]+ clone Pattern
[DONE]+ Check for signature on boot up - wipe everything and write signature if not found etc.
[DONE]+ Clear Data menu?
	- wipe Songs x
	- wipe Patterns x
	- wipe Phrases x
	- wipe Drums x

[DONE]+ modify info display to show BAR:PATTERN in Song Mode
[DONE]+ Clear echo settings when doing Pattern Cut
[DONE]- BUG - wrong sample played first note after a note that has retrigger set
[DONE]+ copy/paste/insert song loop
[DONE]+ Stop tie note from clearing Retrigger value - check retriggering, noticed problem with DCM
[DONE] + BUG if Vibrato Width is negative, make it positive then set phase to do down first
[DONE] + change Song
  (change Song number, read 1st Pattern and load into plyrNextPattern?)
  clear editorLastSongLoop variable (00)
[DONE] + Think about how to set the length of Patterns for playback
[DONE] + Make KillNote kill note immediately
[DONE] + Drum Edit function - Swap A/B
[DONE] + Pattern select should only write to nextPattern when releasing A
[DONE] + Finish off echo for remaining voices and handle switching on/off
[DONE] + Some parameters in Drum Editor need limiting to single digits instead of byte
[DONE] + Move Echo menu to Pattern Menu (or it's own key combo?)
[DONE] + Add copy/paste of echo settings when copying/pasting Patterns
[DONE]+ Tap B on Song Loop to toggle loop on/off
[DONE]+ saving last value in Song and Track Drum/Phrase assign for tapping A (insert last value)
[DONE]+ Auto-Echo? How to edit it?
[DONE]+ Start Trigger Parameters from 00 again - >$7F = off
  Tap B to toggle (EOR #$FF)
  If editing (A+U/D), AND with $7F to turn back on again
[DONE]+ Change one-shot arpeggio on ABC to work like D
[DONE] BUG Noise LFO doesn't seem to be working properly and also check that noise pitch is relative to
      00 and not 01 (01 is A-1)
[DONE] BUG Attack seems to not be working?
[DONE] + Figure out Song Mode
[DONE] + Clone Phrase
[DONE]+ tapping B in Song and Track Drum/Phrase assign
[DONE] + Make blank drum have all voices turned off
[DONE]+ mod parameters that affect more than one parameter in unison?
  GEV = envelope for A, B & D
  GET = gate time for A, B, C & D
  GLW = LFO width for A, B & C
  GLS = LFO speed for A, B, & C
[DONE]+ ghost cursor when editing Trigger Parameters
[DONE]+ copy and paste pattern from Edit Pattern Number mode
[DONE]+ Kill Notes
[DONE] Add clear command to drum parameters and also to trigger parameters
- tap B to clear single drum value (clear in drum needs value map)
- tap B to clear single trigger value (value copied from drum definition)
- hold SELECT, tap A to remap current trigger parameter in each drum trigger of current track
[DONE]+ Moving down (B + DOWN) from Drum Assign and Trigger Window should go to Drum Patch. Save editor mode before going to Drum Patch, then when doing B + UP, go back to previous mode.
[DONE]+ Editing function to shift a track left/right
[DONE]+ Solo Voice in drum (hold B, tap SELECT)
[DONE]+ Mute and Solo tracks. Plus indicators?
[DONE]+ Retriggering
  - no need to copy drum definition when retriggering or reapply trigger parameters
[DONE] + Control to reorder tracks
[DONE] + A "remap trigger parameter" function that will copy the values from the drum definition to the triggers
in the current track. Which parameters get remapped will depend on the trigger index.
[DONE] + A setting where the mod parameters can be set to "OFF" (or "---") in the drum definition
[DONE] + Volume scale!
[DONE] + Tie Notes
[DONE] Implement DCM playback.
- Don't think 6 'virtual' samples are needed, just copy voice E settings to VAPU at time of new note (and
apply sequence step modifiers)
[DONE] Implement handling of voice select flags
[DONE] Change Coarse/Fine pitch stuff
- need to make coarse pitch handle +/- (00 to 4F, FF to B0) and absolute (50 - AF)
- at time of new note, add coarse offset to trigger note
- think about how to handle noise notes
- think about how to handle sample notes
[DONE] - Delay for noise LFO doesn't seem to work.
